# ⚠️Adios, CTACheat⚠️
Development of CTACheat has ceased for several months now. I have lost interest in further developing this project.
I never really liked developing in .NET to be honest as well. Every time I doubled clicked on a form or anything inside a form it would create
a useless function making the source code messier. I tried to recreate CTACheat in Qt and C++ (it would have been called CTACheat++), but I immediately gave up after I remembered how
frustrating C++ can be with variable types and whatnot.
I don't think I should have even tried to program something like this. Clearly I was lacking experience, and in retrospect I feel like I just immediately jumped from JavaScript to other complex
languages. I think I just bit off way more than I could chew, and that is what made me fail.

Farewell, CTACheat, you were my passion project for a couple of weeks.
